Unless you know magic, you access data from  *data files*, which are files just like a PDF documents, JPG images, or whatever, but they are specialized to some degree for containing data. Whether from a colleague, a boss, a webpage, or a government data repository, data will come in a data file that you will need to read as input in order visualize and analyze the data.\n",

We will learn about the fundamental ones. The variables can be used inside the Jupyter Notebook to make pretty graphs, and to do some cool analysis. But what if you want to share the numerical values, the results, of the analysis with someone else? In that case, you can write those values to a data file, save the file and send that to your colleagues.  They can then read in the values on their end without having to wade through your notebook and cutting and pasting or whatever.  "

Packages are directories containing files to a set of modules (or other packages), and Libraries are directories to a set of packages. That having been said, we will tend to refer to them interchagebly as \"*useful chunks of pre-written code we can use!*\"\n",
